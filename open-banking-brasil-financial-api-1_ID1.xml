<note><name>Introduction</name>
<t>The Open Banking Brasil Financial-grade API is a highly secured OAuth profile that aims to provide specific implementation guidelines for security and interoperability which can be applied to APIs in the Brasil Open Banking Area area that require a higher level of privacy than provided by standard <eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html">Financial-grade API Security Profile 1.0 - Part 2: Advanced</eref>. Among other enhancements, this specification addresses privacy considerations identified in <eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html">FAPI-1-Advanced</eref> that are relevent in the Open Banking Brasil specifications but have not, so far, been required by other jurisdictions.</t>
<t>Although it is possible to code an OpenID Provider and Relying Party from first principles using this specification, the main audience for this specification is parties who already have a certified implementation of <eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html">Financial-grade API Security Profile 1.0 - Part 2: Advanced</eref> and want to achieve certification for the Brasil Open Banking programme.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>The Brasil Open Banking Security profile specifies additional security and identity requirements for high risk API resources protected by the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework that consists of <eref target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">RFC6749</eref>, <eref target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750">RFC6750</eref>, <eref target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636">RFC7636</eref>, <eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0.html">FAPI-1-Baseline</eref>, <eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html">FAPI-1-Advanced</eref> and other specifications.</t>
<t>This profile describes security and features provisions for a server and client that are necessary for the Brasil Open Banking Programme by defining the measures to mitigate or address:</t>

<ul>
<li><t>attacks that address privacy considerations identified in clause 9.1 of [FAPI1 Advanced]</t>
</li>
<li><t>the requirement to support fine grained access to resources for data minimisation purposes</t>
</li>
<li><t>the requirement to convey the Authentication Context Request that was performed by an OpenID Provider to a Client to enable a appropriate client management of customer conduct risk.</t>
</li>
<li><t>the requirement for clients to optionally assert a pre-existing customer relationship by asserting a customer identity claim as part of the authorization flow.</t>
</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section anchor="open-banking-brasil-security-provisions"><name>Open Banking Brasil security provisions</name>

<section anchor="introduction-1"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>Open Banking Brasil has a requirement to address privacy considerations that were identified but not addressed in the <eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html">FAPI-1-Advanced</eref> final specification without imposing additional requirements on Authorisation Servers being proposed in <eref target="https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/src/master/FAPI_2_0_Baseline_Profile.md">FAPI-2-Baseline</eref>.
Participants in this ecosystem have a need for clients to request an openid provider to confirm values of identity claims as part of an authorization request using the mechanism defined in clause 5.5.1 of <eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OIDC</eref>.
The use of the claims parameter to request explicit claims values requires clients to ensure that they encrypt the request object to avoid information leakage. This risk is identified in clause 7.4.1 of <eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html">FAPI-1-Advanced</eref>.
In addition this profile describes the specific scope, acr and client management requirements necessary to support the wider Open Banking Brasil ecosystem.</t>
<t>As a profile of the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework, this document mandates the following for the Brasil Open Banking Security profile.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="authorization-server"><name>Authorization server</name>
<t>The Authorization Server shall support the provisions specified in clause 5.2.2 of <eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html">Financial-grade API Security Profile 1.0 - Part 2: Advanced</eref></t>
<t>In addition, the Authorization Server</t>

<ol>
<li><t>shall support a signed and encrypted JWE request object passed by value;</t>
</li>
<li><t>shall distribute discovery metadata (such as the authorization endpoint) via the metadata document as specified in <eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html">OIDD</eref> and [RFC8414]</t>
</li>
<li><t>shall support the claims parameter as defined in clause 5.5 <eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Core</eref></t>
</li>
<li><t>shall support the oidc standard claim &quot;cpf&quot; as defined in clause 5.2.2.2 of this document</t>

<t>In addition, if the <tt>response_type</tt> value <tt>code id_token</tt> is used, the Authorization Server</t>

<ol>
<li><t>should not return sensitive PII in the ID Token in the authorization response, but if it needs to,
then it shall encrypt the ID Token.</t>
</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section anchor="requesting-the-cpf-claim"><name>Requesting the &quot;cpf&quot; Claim</name>
<t>This profile defines &quot;cpf&quot; as a new standard claim as per
 clause 5.1 <eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OIDC</eref></t>
<t>The <strong>CPF</strong> number (Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas, [sepeˈɛfi]; Portuguese for &quot;Natural Persons Register&quot;)
 is the <strong>Brazilian</strong> individual taxpayer registry identification. This number is attributed by
 the <strong>Brazilian</strong> Federal Revenue to Brazilians and resident aliens who, directly or indirectly,
  pay taxes in <strong>Brazil</strong>.
In the Brasil Open Banking identity model, the cpf is a string consisting of numbers that is 11
characters long and may start with a 0.
If the cpf Claim is requested as an Essential Claim for the ID Token or UserInfo response with a
values parameter requesting a specific cpf value, the Authorization Server MUST return an cpf Claim Value
that matches the requested value. If this is an Essential Claim and the requirement cannot be met,
 then the Authorization Server MUST treat that outcome as a failed authentication attempt.</t>
<t>Name: cpf, Type: String, Regex: '<sup>d{11}$'</sup></t>
</section>

<section anchor="requesting-the-cnpj-claim"><name>Requesting the &quot;cnpj&quot; Claim</name>
<t>This profile defines &quot;cnpj&quot; as a new standard claim as per
 clause 5.1<eref target="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OIDC</eref></t>
<t><strong>CNPJ</strong>, short for Cadastro Nacional de Pessoas Jurídicas, is an identification number
 of <strong>Brazilian</strong> companies issued by the <strong>Brazilian</strong> Ministry of Revenue, <strong>in</strong>
 Portuguese &quot;Secretaria da Receita Federal&quot; or &quot;Ministério da Fazenda&quot;. In the Brasil Open Banking identity model,
 individuals can associated with 0 or more CNPJs. A CNPJ is a string consisting of numbers that is 14 digits long and may start with a 0,
 the first eight digits identify the company, the four digits after the slash identify the branch or
  subsidiary (&quot;0001&quot; defaults to the headquarters), and the last two are checksum digits.
   For this profile, the cnpj claim must be requested and supplied as the 14 digit number.</t>
<t>If the cnpj Claim is requested as an Essential Claim for the ID Token or UserInfo response with a
values parameter requesting a specific cnpj value, the Authorization Server MUST return an cnpj
Claim Value that contains a <strong>set</strong> of CNPJs one of which must match the requested value. If this
 is an Essential Claim and the requirement cannot be met, then the Authorization Server MUST treat
 that outcome as a failed authentication attempt.</t>
<t>Name: cnpj, Type: Array of Strings, Array Element Regex: '<sup>d{14}$'</sup></t>
