.# Foreword

The Open Banking Brasil Initial Structure is responsible for creating standards and specifications necessary to meet the requirements and obligations of the Brasil Open Banking Legislation as originally outlined by the [Brasil Central Bank](https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/config/Documents/BCB_Open_Banking_Communique-April-2019.pdf). There is a possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject to patent rights. OBBIS shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.

Open Banking Brasil Financial-grade API Security Profile 1.0 consists of the following parts:

* Open Banking Brasil Financial-grade API Security Profile 1.0
* [Open Banking Brasil Dynamic Client Registration Profile 1.0][OBB-FAPI-DCR]

These parts are intended to be used with [RFC6749], [RFC6750], [RFC7636], [OIDC], [FAPI-1-Baseline] and [FAPI-1-Advanced]

.# Introduction

The Open Banking Brasil Financial-grade API is a highly secured OAuth profile that aims to provide specific implementation guidelines for security and interoperability which can be applied to APIs in the Brasil Open Banking Area area that require a higher level of privacy than provided by standard [Financial-grade API Security Profile 1.0 - Part 2: Advanced][FAPI-1-Advanced]. Among other enhancements, this specification addresses privacy considerations identified in [FAPI-1-Advanced] that are relevent in the Open Banking Brasil specifications but have not, so far, been required by other jurisdictions.

Although it is possible to code an OpenID Provider and Relying Party from first principles using this specification, the main audience for this specification is parties who already have a certified implementation of [Financial-grade API Security Profile 1.0 - Part 2: Advanced][FAPI-1-Advanced] and want to achieve certification for the Brasil Open Banking programme.

# Brasil Open Banking Security Profile

## Introduction

The Brasil Open Banking Security profile specifies additional security and identity requirements for high risk API resources protected by the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework that consists of [RFC6749], [RFC6750], [RFC7636], [FAPI-1-Baseline], [FAPI-1-Advanced] and other specifications.

This profile describes security and features provisions for a server and client that are necessary for the Brasil Open Banking Programme by defining the measures to mitigate or address:

* attacks that address privacy considerations identified in clause 9.1 of [FAPI1 Advanced]
* the requirement to support fine grained access to resources for data minimisation purposes
* the requirement to convey the Authentication Context Request that was performed by an OpenID Provider to a Client to enable a appropriate client management of customer conduct risk.
* the requirement for clients to assert a pre-existing customer relationship by asserting a customer identity claim as part of the authorization flow.

## Open Banking Brasil security provisions

### Introduction

Open Banking Brasil has a requirement to address privacy considerations that were identified but not addressed in the [FAPI-1-Advanced] final specification without imposing additional requirements on Authorisation Servers being proposed in [FAPI-2-Baseline].
Participants in this ecosystem have a need for clients to request an openid provider to confirm values of identity claims as part of an authorization request using the mechanism defined in clause 5.5.1 of [OIDC].
The use of the claims parameter to request explicit claims values requires clients to ensure that they encrypt the request object to avoid information leakage. This risk is identified in clause 7.4.1 of [FAPI-1-Advanced].
In addition this profile describes the specific scope, acr and client management requirements necessary to support the wider Open Banking Brasil ecosystem.

As a profile of the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework, this document mandates the following for the Brasil Open Banking Security profile.

### Authorization server

The Authorization Server shall support the provisions specified in clause 5.2.2 of [Financial-grade API Security Profile 1.0 - Part 2: Advanced][FAPI-1-Advanced]

In addition, the Authorization Server

1. shall support a signed and encrypted JWE request object passed by value or shall require pushed authorization requests [PAR];
2. shall distribute discovery metadata (such as the authorization endpoint) via the metadata document as specified in [OIDD] and [RFC8414]
3. shall support the claims parameter as defined in clause 5.5 [OpenID Connect Core][OIDC]
4. shall support the oidc standard claim "cpf" as defined in clause 5.2.2.2 of this document
5. shall support the oidc standard claim "cnpj" as defined in clause 5.2.2.3 of this document
6. shall support the acr "urn:brasil:openbanking:loa2" as defined in clause 5.2.2.4 of this document
7. should support the acr "urn:brasil:openbanking:loa3" as defined in clause 5.2.2.4 of this document
8. shall implement the user info endpoint as defined in clause 5.3 [OpenID Connect Core][OIDC]
9. shall support parameterized OAuth 2.0 resource scope _consent_ as defined in clause 6.3.1 [OIDF FAPI WG Lodging Intent Pattern][LIWP]
10. may support [Financial-grade API: Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication Profile][FAPI-CIBA]
11. shall support [Financial-grade API: Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication Profile][FAPI-CIBA] if scope includes _payments_
12. may require the presence of a populated cpf value claim if scope includes dynamic resource scope _consent_
13. shall support refresh tokens

#### ID Token as detached signature

The Authorization Server shall support the provisions specified in clause 5.2.2.1 of [Financial-grade API Security Profile 1.0 - Part 2: Advanced][FAPI-1-Advanced]

In addition, if the `response_type` value `code id_token` is used, the Authorization Server

1. should not return sensitive PII in the ID Token in the authorization response, but if it needs to,
then it shall encrypt the ID Token.

#### Requesting the "cpf" Claim

This profile defines "cpf" as a new standard claim as per
 clause 5.1 [OIDC]

The **CPF** number (Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas, [sepeˈɛfi]; Portuguese for "Natural Persons Register")
 is the **Brazilian** individual taxpayer registry identification. This number is attributed by
 the **Brazilian** Federal Revenue to Brazilians and resident aliens who, directly or indirectly,
  pay taxes in **Brazil**.
In the Brasil Open Banking identity model, the cpf is a string consisting of numbers that is 11
characters long and may start with a 0.
If the cpf Claim is requested as an Essential Claim for the ID Token or UserInfo response with a
values parameter requesting a specific cpf value, the Authorization Server MUST return an cpf Claim Value
that matches the requested value. If this is an Essential Claim and the requirement cannot be met,
 then the Authorization Server MUST treat that outcome as a failed authentication attempt.

Name: cpf, Type: String, Regex: '^\d{11}$'

#### Requesting the "cnpj" Claim

This profile defines "cnpj" as a new standard claim as per
 clause 5.1[OIDC]

**CNPJ**, short for Cadastro Nacional de Pessoas Jurídicas, is an identification number
 of **Brazilian** companies issued by the **Brazilian** Ministry of Revenue, **in**
 Portuguese "Secretaria da Receita Federal" or "Ministério da Fazenda". In the Brasil Open Banking identity model,
 individuals can associated with 0 or more CNPJs. A CNPJ is a string consisting of numbers that is 14 digits long and may start with a 0,
 the first eight digits identify the company, the four digits after the slash identify the branch or
  subsidiary ("0001" defaults to the headquarters), and the last two are checksum digits.
   For this profile, the cnpj claim must be requested and supplied as the 14 digit number.

If the cnpj Claim is requested as an Essential Claim for the ID Token or UserInfo response with a
values parameter requesting a specific cnpj value, the Authorization Server MUST return an cnpj
Claim Value that contains a **set** of CNPJs one of which must match the requested value. If this
 is an Essential Claim and the requirement cannot be met, then the Authorization Server MUST treat
 that outcome as a failed authentication attempt.

Name: cnpj, Type: Array of Strings, Array Element Regex: '^\d{14}$'

#### Requesting the "urn:brasil:openbanking:loa2" or "urn:brasil:openbanking:loa3" Authentication Context Request

This profile defines "urn:brasil:openbanking:loa2" and "urn:brasil:openbanking:loa3" as
 new Authentication Context Request classes.

* **LoA2:** Authentication performed using single factor;
* **LoA3:** Authentication performed using multi factor (MFA)

The following rules are applicable:
* **Read-only APIs :** Shall request at least LoA2, and be raised to LoA3 based on the entity performing the end user authentication (in accordance with current resolution);
* **Read-and-Write APIs (Transactional):** Shall request at least LoA3.

**Authentication factors clarification**

The authentication methods are:

* Something you know, such as password or phrase
* Something you have, such as token or smartcard;
* Something you are, such as biometric validation.

To performe a MFA authentication is necessary the end user to present at least two different methods as listed above. A unique method used more than once is not accepted as MFA.

### Confidential client

A confidential client shall support the provisions specified in clause 5.2.3 of
[Financial-grade API Security Profile 1.0 - Part 1: Advanced][FAPI-1-Advanced],

In addition, the confidential client

1. shall support _encrypted_ request objects
2. shall support pushed authorisation requests [PAR]
3. shall use _encrypted_ request objects if not using [PAR]
4. shall support parameterized OAuth 2.0 resource scope _consent_ as defined in clause 6.3.1 [OIDF FAPI WG Lodging Intent Pattern][LIWP]
5. shall support refresh tokens
6. shall include a populated cpf value claim if scope includes dynamic resource scope _consent_

# Security considerations

Participants shall support all security considerations specified in clause 8
 [Financial-grade API Security Profile 1.0 - Part 1: Advanced][FAPI-1-Advanced] and the [Brazilian Central Bank Open Banking Security Manual](https://www.bcb.gov.br/estabilidadefinanceira/exibenormativo?tipo=Instru%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Normativa%20BCB&numero=99).
 The Brazilian ICP issues RSA x509 certificates only therefor section removes for simplicity support for EC algorithms
 and requires that only IANA recommended encryption algorithms be used.

## Algorithm considerations

For JWS, clients, Resource Server endpoints and Authorization Servers

1. shall use PS256 algorithm;
2. shall use [RFC7515] specification as the method for message signature;

### Encryption algorithm considerations

For JWE, both clients and Authorization Servers

1. shall use RSA-OAEP with A256GCM

### Secure Use of Transport Layer Security considerations

For TLS, Authorization Server endpoints and Resource Server endpoints used directly by the Client

1. shall support `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
2. shall support `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`

# Data Sharing Considerations

## Authorisation Mechanism

### Introduction

Existing mechanisms for appropriately managing access to resources defined in [RFC6749] are insufficient to meet the requirements for a modern data sharing ecosystem. Leveraging static scope strings does not provide consumers control of sufficient granularity to share with third parties. Open Banking Brasil have elected to implement a [Consent API](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/swagger/swagger_consents_apis.yaml) as a OAuth 2.0 protected resource that can be used to manage fine grain access to resources. The reference to the Consent Resource will be conveyed as part of an OAuth 2.0 dynamic resource scope.

### Dynamic Consent Scope Definition

This profile defines OAuth 2.0 dynamic scope "consent" as follows:

* string 'consent'; and
* delimiter of a colon ":"; and
* Consent API REST Resource Id as returned by a successful creation of [Open Banking Consent Resource](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/#fase-2-apis-do-open-banking-brasil-api-consentimento);

In addition:

* the Consent Resource Id must include  url safe characters only;
* the Consent Resource Id must be namespaced;
* the Consent Resource Id must have the properties of a nonce;

### Dynamic Consent Scope Example

consent:urn:bancoex:C1DD33123

## Authorisation Life Cycle

### Introduction

The Consent Resource has a life cycle that is managed seperately and distinctly from the OAuth 2.0 Authorisation Framework. The state transitions and expected behaviours and error conditions expected of REST Resouces protected with this profile are defined in the functional API specifications published by Open Banking Brasil.

### Authorization server

In addition to the requirements outlined in Open Banking Brasil security provisions the Authorization Server

1. shall revoke refresh tokens and where practicable access tokens when the linked Consent Resource is deleted;
2. shall ensure Access Tokens are issued with sufficient scope necessary for access to data specified in the Permissions element of a linked Consent Resource object;
3. shall not reject an authorisation request requesting more scope than is necessary to access data specified in the Permissions element of a linked Consent Resource object;
4. may reduce requested scope to a level sufficient to enable access to data resources specified in the Permissions element of a linked Consent Resource object;

### Confidential Client

In addition to the requirements outlined in Open Banking Brasil security provisions the Confidential Client

1. shall revoke where possible and cease usage of refresh and access tokens that are bound to a Consent Resource that has been deleted;
1. shall delete Consent Resource that are expired;

# Regulatory Considerations

## Requirement on Client to present cpf claim to AS {#Reg}

[Joint Resolution No 1, Art. 10, paragraph VI](https://www.in.gov.br/en/web/dou/-/resolucao-conjunta-n-1-de-4-de-maio-de-2020-255165055)
The interpretation of the Compliance team requires the TPPs to identify the customer before requesting access to resources from a bank. The mechanism adopted is to require the TPP to include a populated customer cpf claim as part of a request object when the request to the bank includes a request for access to a account or payment resources which is
 conveyed by a dynamic scope of 'consent:{consentId}'.

This assertion is considered to be sufficient to meet the requirements of the legislation but does result in the requirement for customers to provide to third parties this information ahead of requesting an open banking flow.
 Banks that wish to prevent poor customer experiences or help mitigate the need for customers to key in sensitive details into third party UIs can provide the cpf and other attributes as part of a consent journey
 provided that they do so without also accepting a request for data sharing at the same time.

The sharing of customer atttributes without a corresponding open banking resource sharing request is out of scope of the regulation which means that banks are not obliged to offer this service but there is no technical barrier with them doing.
The security profile has been specifically drafted to enable and encourage banks to facilitate this two step process which significantly improves the new customer experience for tpps and prevents the bad practice of encouraging consumers to manually share sentitive personal information into websites. Removing the need for this activity is one of the primary security goals of Open Banking and the OpenID Foundation Financial Grade Working Group on whose standards this profile is based.
