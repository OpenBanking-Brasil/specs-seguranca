# Open Banking Brasil Standard

## Introduction

The Open Banking Brazil ecosystem makes use of chains of certificates and TLS protocol to guarantee the confidentiality, authentication and integrity of the communication channel used by the APIs of the participating organizations, as well as the customers of each of the participants.

The certificates used by Open Banking Brasil are also required to authenticate applications through oAuth 2.0 mTLS or private_key_jwt, in addition to being used to perform the payload signature using JWS. Another important attribution of certificates is to authenticate and present a secure channel to the end user in the act of authentication and use of services provided by the participating organizations.

## ICP-Brasil Certificates

Certificates issued by Certifying Authorities authorized by ICP-Brasil are only used for communication between entities participating in the Open Banking Brasil ecosystem.

The certificate issuing and revocation processes are responsibility of the Certifate Authorities themselves, being regulated by Certification Practice Statements, and supervised by the Management Committee of the Brazilian Public Key Infrastructure (Comitê Gestor da Infraestrutura de Chaves Públicas Brasileira).

The practices, processes, availability and values practiced by the Certification Authorities are not responsibility of the Initial Structure of Open Banking Brasil.

**Algorithms**

All certificates issued by ICP-Brasil must have the following characteristics:

* Type A of ICP-Brasil;
* Key Algorithms: RSA 2048 bits;
* Message Digest: SHA 256 bits.

### Server Certificate

The Server Certificate must be issued to protect and authenticate the TLS channel used by the APIs that will be consumed by client applications of organizations participating in Open Banking.

The certificate standard used must follow the existing certificate issuing practices of "CERTIFICATE FOR WEB SERVER – ICP-Brasil".

The server certificate shall be sent with the intermediate chain, according to [RFC5246] (items 7.4.2).

### Client Certificate

Client Application Certificates (Transport) are used to authenticate the mTLS channel and to authenticate the client application through oAuth2.0 mTLS or private_key_jwt, according to the application registration performed by the Dynamic Client Registration process with the transmitting organization. Regarding mTLS, the client certificate shall be sent with the intermediate chain, according to [RFC5246] (items 7.4.2 and 7.4.6).

To issue a Client Certificate, the participating organization in Open Banking Brasil must register the application in the Directory Service through the Software Statement Assertion issue process, and thus have already obtained the Software Statement ID value.

#### Open Banking Brasil Attributes

* **serialNumber:** National Register of Legal Personnel (CNPJ) of the legal entity holding the certificate and associated with the UID attribute and Software Statement ID, during validation with the Directory Service of Open Banking Brasil;
* **organizationalUnitName:** Participant Code associated with the CNPJ listed in the Directory Service of Open Banking Brasil;
* **UID:** Software Statement ID registered in the Directory Service of Open Banking Brasil and belonging to the CNPJ and Participant Code.

The Client Certificate must be issued through the V10 chain, and must contain the following attributes:

**Distinguished Name**

**Certificate Extensions**

* **keyUsage:** critical,digitalSignature,keyEncipherment
* **extendedKeyUsage:** clientAuth

**Subject Alternative Name**

### Signature Certificate

Signature Certificates are used to perform payload signature through the use of JWS (JSON Web Signature).

#### Open Banking Brasil Attributes Present in the Certificate

* **UID:** Participant Code associated with the CNPJ listed in the Directory Service of Open Banking Brasil;
* **commonName:** Company Name registered in the Directory Service of Open Banking Brasil and belonging to the CNPJ and Participant Code.

The Signature Certificate must be issued through the V5 chain, and must contain the following attributes:

**Distinguished Name**

* **UID (OID 0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1):** Participant Code associated with the CNPJ listed in the Directory Service of Open Banking Brazil

#### Participating Certificate Authorities

The following certifying authorities carried out the onboard process for Open Banking Brasil and are authorized to issue Open Banking Brasil certificates.

* Serasa
* Serpro
* Soluti

### Front-End Certificates

x509 Certificates that are used to secure communication channels between end-users browsers and banks services must be trusted be issued by a certificate authority certified by the CA Browser Forum. In addition, and to ensure greater interoperability, certificates must meet the requirements for CAB Forum EV (Extended Validation), following the rules defined in RFC 5280 and RFC 2818, in accordance with the principles and WebTrust criteria.

### About certificates for exchanging information between authorized institutions and partners (non-participating)

According to section IV of Joint Resolution No. 1 of May 4, 2020, the establishment of bilateral partnerships between authorized institutions and partners is an arrangement provided in the regulation and which must observe, where applicable, the same standards and certificates requirements that are applicable to exchange of information between participating institutions.

In accordance with §2 of Art. 10 of Provisional Measure 2200-2 of August 24, 2001 and with the provisions of item 3.12 in BCB Normative Instruction No. 134, for bilateral communication between institutions and partners, the use is authorized, by mutual agreement between the parties, of a private PKI, provided that the requirements of this _profile for security certificates_ are observed, including their formatting, algorithms and established attributes.

The values for filling in the attributes required in this specification, but not applicable to the partner, should be defined in common agreement between the authorized institution and the partner, which does not exempt the authorized institution from the responsibility for filling it in properly.
