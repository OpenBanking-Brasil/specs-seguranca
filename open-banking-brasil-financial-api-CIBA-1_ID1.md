The Open Banking Brasil Initial Structure is responsible for creating standards and specifications necessary to meet the requirements and obligations of the Brasil Open Banking Legislation as originally outlined by the [Brasil Central Bank](https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/config/Documents/BCB_Open_Banking_Communique-April-2019.pdf). There is a possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject to patent rights. OBBIS shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.

Open Banking Brasil Financial-grade API Security Profile 1.0 consists of the following parts:

* Open Banking Brasil Financial-grade API Security Profile 1.0
* [Open Banking Brasil Dynamic Client Registration Profile 1.0][OBB-FAPI-DCR]

These parts are intended to be used with [RFC6749], [RFC6750], [RFC7636], [OIDC], [FAPI-1-Baseline] and [FAPI-1-Advanced]

.# Introduction
The Financial-grade API Standard provides a profile for OAuth 2.0 suitable for use in financial services. The standard OAuth method for the client to send the resource owner to the authorization server is to use an HTTP redirect. Parts 1 and 2 of this specification support this interaction model and are suitable for use cases where the resource owner is interacting with the client on a device they control that has a web browser. There are however many use-cases for initiating payments where the resource owner is not interacting with the client in such a manner. For example, the resource owner may want to authorize a payment at a "point of sale" terminal at a shop or fuel station.

This document is a profile of the OpenID Connect Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow [CIBA] that supports this decoupled interaction method. The CIBA spec allows a client that gains knowledge of an identifier for the user to obtain tokens from the authorization server. The user consent is given at the user's Authentication Device mediated by the authorization server. This document profiles the CIBA specification to bring it in line with the other FAPI parts and provides security recommendations for its use with APIs that require financial-grade security.

Although it is possible to code an OpenID Provider and Relying Party from first principles using this specification, the main audience for this specification is parties who already have a certified implementation of [Financial-grade API: Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication Profile][FAPI-CIBA] and want to achieve certification for the Brasil Open Banking programme.

# Brasil Open Banking Security Profile

## Introduction

The Brasil Open Banking Security profile specifies additional security and identity requirements for high risk API resources protected by the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework that consists of [RFC6749], [RFC6750], [RFC7636], [FAPI-1-Baseline], [FAPI-1-Advanced], [FAPI-CIBA] and other specifications.

This profile describes security and features provisions for a server and client that are necessary for the Brasil Open Banking Programme by defining the measures to address:

* the requirement to convey the Authentication Context Request that was performed by an OpenID Provider to a Client to enable a appropriate client management of customer conduct risk.
* the requirement for clients to assert a pre-existing customer relationship by asserting a customer identity claim as part of the CIBA flow.

## Open Banking Brasil CIBA Security provisions

### Introduction

Open Banking Brasil has a requirement to adopt Client [Initiated Back Channel Authentication][CIBA] as a means of enabling decoupled authentication work flows.
In addition this profile describes the specific scope, acr and client management requirements necessary to support the wider Open Banking Brasil ecosystem.

As a profile of the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework, this document mandates the following for the Brasil Open Banking Security profile.

### Authorization server

The Authorization Server shall support the provisions specified in clause 5.2.2 of [Financial-grade API CIBA Security Profile 1.0][FAPI-CIBA]

In addition, the Authorization Server

1. shall distribute discovery metadata (such as the authorization endpoint) via the metadata document as specified in [OIDD] and [RFC8414]
2. shall support the claims parameter as defined in clause 5.5 [OpenID Connect Core][OIDC]
3. shall support the oidc standard claim "cpf" as defined in clause 5.2.2.2 of [FAPI-BR]
4. shall support the oidc standard claim "cnpj" as defined in clause 5.2.2.3 of [FAPI-BR] if providing access to resources where the resource owner is not a `natural person`
5. shall support the acr "urn:brasil:openbanking:loa2" as defined in clause 5.2.2.4 of FAPI-BR
6. should support the acr "urn:brasil:openbanking:loa3" as defined in clause 5.2.2.4 of [FAPI-BR]]
7. shall implement the userinfo endpoint as defined in clause 5.3 [OpenID Connect Core][OIDC]
8. shall support parameterized OAuth 2.0 resource scope _consent_ as defined in clause 6.3.1 [OIDF FAPI WG Lodging Intent Pattern][LIWP]
9. shall support refresh tokens
10. shall issue access tokens with an expiry no greater than 900 seconds and no less than 300 seconds
11. shall always include an acr claim in the `id_token`
12. shall require the Signed Authentication Request to contain nbf and exp claims that limit the lifetime of the request to no more than 10 minutes
13. shall issue ciba auth request acknowledgements with a minimum expiry of 6 minutes;

### Confidential client

In addition, the confidential client

1. shall support parameterized OAuth 2.0 resource scope _consent_ as defined in clause 6.3.1 [OIDF FAPI WG Lodging Intent Pattern][LIWP]
2. shall support refresh tokens
3. shall not populate the `acr` claim with required values
4. shall require the `acr` claim as an essential claim

### Resource Owner identity hint mechanisms

#### Introduction

As described in [FAPI-CIBA], there are many mechanisms that can be used to convey a Resource Owners identity from the Consumption Device to the Authorization Server however in call cases this identity attestation must be treated as a `hint` only. There are naturally limitations on the types of id hints that can be captured by the consumption device based on the input and output contraints of the device being used. In addition to input and output challenges, there are several key privacy and security conerns that must be evaluated when defining id conveyance processes. This profile defines several `login hint` types that must be supported by authorisation servers.

[FAPI-CIBA] requires requests to be signed, there is no requirement in Brazil to additionally sign these hints as they are all asserted by the Client.

##### Credit Proposition - Login Hint Token

`
{
  "format": "urn:brasil:openbanking:ciba:login-hint-token-type:credit-proposition",
  "cpf": "12354678901",
  "total_hints": 6,
  "hint_number": 1
}
`

The use of a `binding message` is *not* mandatory if this token type is to be leveraged.
The requested_expiry shall be greater than 3600 seconds and less than 43200 seconds

##### Authorisation Server Generated - Login Hint Token

This `login hint` can be used where it is not possible for the Resource Owner to provide a Login Hint to the Consumption Device or where the Resource Owner wishes to claim the authentication request by independently reaching out to the Authorisation Server out of band to claim this authentication request.

`
{
    "format": "urn:brasil:openbanking:ciba:login-hint-token-type:as-generated"
}
`

The use of a `binding message` is mandatory if this token type is to be leveraged.

###### Authorisation Server Generated - Login Hint Presentation

Presentation of the Authorisation Server Generated Token must be in the format of a JWE displayed as a QR Code with the following properties in the following way.

JWS Creation

1. The payload of signed messages (request _JWT_) shall include the following claims as defined at [RFC7519] (JWT):

* **aud** the Authorization Servers advertised issuer as per [OIDD];
* **iss** the receiver of the message shall validate if the value of the **iss** field matches the `clientId` of the sender;
* **jti** the value of the **jti** field shall be filled with the UUID defined by the institution according to [RFC4122] version 4;
* **iat** the **iat** field  shall be filled with the message generation time and according to the standard established in [RFC7519](https:// datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-2) to the _NumericDate_ format.
* ***exp** the **exp** field  shall be filled with the message expiry time and according to the standard established in [RFC7519](https:// datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-2) to the _NumericDate_ format with an maximum value not greater than 5 minutes;
* **auth_request_id** the authentication request id returned from the Authorisation Server CIBA requst.

2. The JOSE header must contain the following attributes:
   * **alg** - shall be filled with the value `PS256`";
   * **kid** - shall be filled with the key identifier value used for the signature listed on the `software statement` keystore on the Open Banking Brasil Directory of Participants;
   * **typ** - shall be filled with the value `JWT`.

JWE Creation

1. The JOSE header must contain the following attributes:
   * **alg** - shall be filled with the value `RSA-OAEP`";
   * **enc** - shall be filled with the value `A256GCM`";
   * **kid** - shall be filled with the encryption key identifier `kid` value used to encrypt the JWE with the encryption key advertised on the authorisation servers jwks endpoint;
   * **cty** - shall be filled with the value `JWT`.

##### Authentication Device Generated - Login Hint Token

This `login hint token` should be used when Client has requested a unique identifier be provided by the Resource Owner to the Consumption Device. It is recommended that this identifier be dynamic, time based, have sufficient entropy and short lived to prevent replay attacks.

`
{
    "format": "urn:brasil:openbanking:ciba:login-hint-token-type:ad-generated",
    "id": "11112222333344445555"
}
`

The use of a `binding message` is mandatory if this token type is to be leveraged.

##### Static CPF - Login Hint Token

This `login hint token` could be used when Client has requested a static identifier be provided by the Resource Owner to the Consumption Device. It is not recommended that Banks support this mechanism due to the significant privacy and security concerns identified [FAPI-CIBA] and [CIBA]

`
{
    "format": "urn:brasil:openbanking:ciba:login-hint-token-type:cpf",
    "id": "12354678901"
}
`

The use of a `binding message` is mandatory if this token type is to be leveraged.
